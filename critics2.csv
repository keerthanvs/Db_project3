Name of critic,Epidose,review
Fiona Flynn,E1,"It's also worth noting it was actually quite a funny episode (screaming dead kids aside), with one-liners galore and plenty of witty exchanges."
Soham Gadre,E1,"Winterfell was content with merely laying the groundwork for possible things to come. In a sense, it was a giant series of family reunions."
Michael Walsh,E1,"Rather than using that highly anticipated ride as a game-changing confirmation of Jon's true birth, it was used to set up a fun joy ride that ended with a big laugh."
AJ Willingham,E1,"Maybe it's just a vibe, but it seems like the Golden Company's leader has absolutely no idea what he's gotten himself into and will not be pleased when he figures it out."
Michael Deacon,E1,"It was the most dramatic moment of an otherwise restrained scene-setter, largely composed of reunions and introductions. With only five more episodes of the show left to come, the lack of urgency did feel slightly frustrating."
Barry Hertz,E1,"Going forward, the only preparation I can offer is no preparation at all. All men, the saying goes, must die. Maybe our expectations should, too."
Huw Saunders,E2,"It's aware, as Thrones always has been, that something's going to be happening in the future, but this comes to the detriment of the here and now."
Louise Rugendyke,E2,"Sure, it kinda felt like watching your parents have sex but good on Arya, she's a woman of many faces and now she's a bastard-king-in-waiting slayer."
Evan Davis,E2,"Sunday's episode often felt like it was spinning its wheels, waiting for the battle to finally arrive. Bryan Cogman's dialogue lays it on fairly thick, not always sure of when to pull back."
Ned Lannamann,E2,"It was a BAD but necessary episode, setting the table for next week's big battle... For me, not enough actually happened, and the things that did move the pieces forward."
Chris Barton,E2,[W]e might as well enjoy another episode-length moment to reflect on these characters' humanity and how far they've come.
Barry Hertz,E2,"If last night's episode was goodbye, it was as compelling and problematic as Game of Thrones has always been"
Graeme Virtue,E2,"In a show characterised by grim scowls on the battlefield or false faces while someone pours poison into your drink, Brienne's genuine smile shone through."
Spencer Kornhaber,E2,"The show is done with intrigue for now... Thrones is also apparently done mounting scenes that are riveting in their own right, rather than ones that just cash in on years of pent-up audience desires.

"
Sarah Larson,E3,"It was a bloodbath ending in ice chips, and we emerged feeling good."
Chris Barton,E3,"Still, with an aptly named episode called ""The Long Night"" that challenged its audience to find the brightness control on their televisions...the series delivered on many of its promises while stopping short of a few of its threats."
Matthew Gilbert,E3,"I do love ""Game of Thrones,"" but in the middle of ""The Long Night,"" my love was tested. The effort to pepper the battle with human set pieces lost out to shadowy bluster."
Karl Quinn,E3,"The living can win is by killing the dead. Which is a bit confusing, for sure, but certainly not the last bit of mind-f---ery this mammoth 82-minute episode has in store for us."
Alan Sepinwall,E3,"If the war with the army of the dead was just meant as misdirection for the real final fight, then the least it could have given us was better spectacle than most of what ""The Long Night"" had to offer."
Robert Rorke,E3,Amid the smoke and clouds and flying dragon fights there were several dramatic highpoints.
AJ Willingham,E3,They were all bad. These were all bad scenes and none of them were pleasant.
Travis M. Andrews,E3,"It's a nuanced and patient bit of storytelling, one that has paid off in dividends. There's arguably no character as well-developed as Arya, and unlike some other characters on the show, her story arc actually feels earned."
Lili Loofbourow,E4,"""The Last of the Starks"" was a fascinating lesson in how Westerosi official histories come about."
Matthew Gilbert,E4,"I didn't think the episode, called ""The Last of the Starks,"" was particularly smooth overall.

"
David Malitz,E4,"Maybe it was just good luck on those initial kill shots, though, because the next few dozen arrows that fly toward Daenerys and Drogon all miss their mark. Every single one of them. Yep.

"
Kathryn VanArendonk,E4,"Even under that best-case scenario, though it's hard to imagine the last two episodes of Game of Thrones could fully recover from the way ""The Last of the Starks"" betrays Brienne, Sansa, and Missandei."
Sarah Hughes,E4,"Where a lesser show would have hurried the action, moving us swiftly on to the battle with Cersei, The Last of the Starks took time to show what the true cost of the Battle of Winterfell was.

"
Barry Hertz,E4,"Although the episode contained a handful of surprises, it engineered the twists in a fashion that felt rushed, preposterous and insulting."
Karl Quinn,E4,"So Varys, the arch political schemer and great cynic, turns out to be the greatest idealist in Game of Thrones. Who saw that coming?"
Shirley Li,E4,"If it were a character, it'd be Gendry: It got down on its knees, drunkenly updated me on its latest victory, then tried to make me buy into the fact that moving on after fighting a battle against actual ice zombies is fairly easy to do."
Robert Rorke,E5,"It was shocking, and like the best of ""Thrones,"" unexpected. But you can't say we weren't warned."
Karl Quinn,E5,"So it turns out there is an enemy more fearsome than the Night King for the long-suffering folk of Westeros after all. It's the woman who's come to save them.

"
Chris Barton,E5,"Whether that plan can still coalesce into a satisfying ""GOT"" ending will be decided next week, but with so much hinging on accepting this reversal by Daenerys... that is feeling like another long shot."
Verne Gay,E5,"It was one of those episodes designed to exhaust fans as much as sate curiosities - their own ""Game of Thrones"" drinking contests now ended in one, bloody whoosh."
David Malitz,E5,"Why am I weirdly nostalgic for the Night King? That can't be good.)

"
Willa Paskin,E5,"The show is hitting viewers in the nose, extremely hard, with an idea that has been latent since the beginning: that rooting for anyone is a loser's game."
Maureen Ryan,E5,"To say the show befouled the bed in its penultimate episode, ""The Bells,"" is putting it mildly."
Kathryn VanArendonk,E5,"Disheartened isn't even the right word. I am exhausted by Mad Queen Dany, with the kind of fatigue that leads to jaw-cracking yawns and deep, resigned sighs."
Eric Deggans,E6,"We saw big moments, like the death of heroine-turned-despite Daenerys Targaryen. They happened quickly, and they kind of seemed anticlimactic.

"
Hugo Rifkind,E6,"Lots of epic shows feel a little underpopulated towards the end but there's really no excuse for something as mythic, huge and mesmerising to end as disappointingly as this."
Sam Adams,E6,It's an ending only a writer could love.
Isaac Butler,E6,"The oddest aspect of the long-awaited, much derided, but actually pretty good finale of Game of Thrones is that it tries to sell an aristocratic coup as a glorious revolution."
Amanda Marcotte,E6,"The last season felt a bit rushed at times, thought not nearly as much as the extremely online have been saying, but it was incredibly impressive how the show stayed true to the vision until the end.

"
Barry Hertz,E6,"As in, ugh, how did Benioff and Weiss (and, we can only assume, Martin) find and then magnify every flaw in what has otherwise been a fantastic production?

"
Matthew Gilbert,E6,Some of the choices were off - but the tone and pace were just right.
Hugh Montgomery,E6,"In the end, similarly, some characters were served better than others by Benioff and Weiss - spare a thought for example, for poor Brienne of Tarth.

"
Dan Kois,E6,"In this final episode, needing only to execute George R.R. Martin's ending, they clearly made a choice: to lean into the things their show does better than most other shows. It was the right choice!"
Inkoo Kang,E6,Feels lazy and false. It's not much of a happy ending to go from placing our faith in kings and queens to trusting the judgment of unseen and unaccountable committee meetings.
Willa Paskin,E1,"Momentum, the idea that we are hurtling toward some conclusion that will explain it all, has been so encoded into the Game of Thrones experience that in the absence of any forward motion, the show is ... kind of dull."
Rob Bricken,E1,"If Game of Thrones manages to spend its remaining time wisely, maybe I'll be equally glad the show didn't waste more time on Jon's other milestones"
Ed Cumming,E1,The truth the hype industry can't acknowledge is that Game of Thrones has grown less interesting as it has increased in size
Nick Hilton,E2,"If some found this season's opening episode a little light on action and rather heavy on character reunions, then ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"" offers no respite.

"
Anna Leszkiewicz,E2,"I like Game of Thrones when it is slower, chattier, and more character-focused, but at times, this episode became repetitive."
Jeva Lange,E2, It also highlighted the biggest problem Game of Thrones has this season: the utter lack of chemistry in its marquee relationships.
Pat Stacey,E3,"Even a relatively disinterested observer like me can tell this was a feeble anticlimax. Still, it wasn't the climax proper."
Andrew Bloom,E3,"""The Long Night"" can't help but feel like something of a disappointment."
Judy Berman,E3,"Game of Thrones still has three weeks to end on a thrilling note. It's just getting harder and harder, with each new episode, to imagine how that finale could possibly deliver on eight seasons' worth of anticipation.

"
Kelly Lawler,E4,It was a clumsy and overlong episode that tried to do far too much with far too little.
Soumya Srivastava,E4,"All in all, this episode was one the biggest disappointments of the season so far. But hey! At least we could see all of it without needing to squint or adjusting brightness levels on our screens."
Emily VanDerWerff,E4,"It was nearly an hour and 20 minutes long, but the overall effect was mildly chaotic, with a whole bunch of things happening and very few of them having the emotional weight that Game of Thrones clearly hoped they would have."
Melissa Leon,E5,The penultimate episode of the HBO epic failed to service its main characters..
Erik Henriksen,E5,"What an airless, joyless slog of an episode."
Jasmyne Keimig,E5,I think this was a hot garbage fire of an episode. Hot. Garbage. Fire.
Michelle Ruiz,E6,Disappointment is running high after Sunday's Game of Thrones finale....
Ned Lannamann,E6,"Pretty unhappy, but not exactly disappointed, because I think we all knew this was going to be a bumpy landing."
